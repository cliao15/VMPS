This project aims at calculation of groud state and relavant properties of 1D ANNNI model
with transverse and longitudinal field using MPS (Matrix Product State) representation.

Input:
(1)     J1      constant for nearest neighboring interaction
(2)     J2      constant for next nearest neighboring interaction
(3)     Hx      transverse field strength
(4)     Hz      longtitude field strength
(5)     Tol     error tolerance
(6)     N       number of sites
(7)     BoundaryCondition      boundary condition (OBC(0)/PBC(1))
(8)     Method  Exact Diagolization(0)/VMPS(1)/Time Evolution(2)
(9)     FES     0/1 whether calculating first excited state?
(10)    Gap     0/1 output energy gap
(11)    Magx    0/1 output magnetization in X direaction
(12)    Magy    0/1 output magnetization in Y direaction
(13)    Magz    0/1 output magnetization in Z direaction
(14)    Corr    correlation length
(15)    Cxx     0/1 output correlation in X direaction with length Corr
(16)    Cyy     0/1 output correlation in Y direaction with length Corr
(17)    Czz     0/1 output correlation in Z direaction with length Corr


Output:
(1) State energy
(2) State Configuration
(3) statistical data

#   Installation
[1] mkdir build
[2] cd build
[3] cmake ..
[4] make

The executable file is in the directory build/bin. Users could copy the input
file from directory script and modify the parameters. Then type ./qsAnnni and 
the programme should work.
